How to use the folder
 the entire agi_roadmap/ into repo root.
Create feature-branch sprint-01.
Open 01_state_machine.md → follow Files touched → paste snippets.
Toggle SETTINGS.agent_state_machine = true in config/settings.yaml.
Deploy – old endpoints still work; new behaviour only for pilot users.
Repeat for 02…08.
When you finish sprint-08 you will have every subsystem required for AGI—all without ever breaking the production DCLA pipeline that is already live.
