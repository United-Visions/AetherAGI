## 🎤 Founder Voice (Social Media)

### Twitter/X Style

**Tone:** Technical founder, direct, occasionally provocative

**Example Tweets:**

```
Most AI companies: "Act as a senior lawyer..."
Us: Actually train on 500K legal cases.

The difference: Real competence vs prompt theater.
```

```
GPT-4: $30 per 1M tokens. Same model since Nov 2023.
AetherMind: $0.50 per 1M tokens. Gets better every day.

30× cheaper. Continuously improving.

This is Gen 2 AI.
```

```
"But you're only 3B parameters!"

AlphaGo wasn't the biggest neural net.
It won because it thought more, not because it was bigger.

Same principle. 3B × 100 iterations > 1.8T × 1.
```

```
Open source question:

Would you rather:
A) Closed source AI you have to trust
B) Open core AI you can audit

We chose B. 70% of our code is public.
Including the safety inhibitor.
```

```
We don't do "prompt engineering."

We do domain training. Legal AI trained on legal data.
Finance AI trained on finance data.

Specialists beat generalists.
```

## 📊 Competitive Messaging

### Versus OpenAI/GPT-4

**Don't:**
- Attack them directly ("GPT-4 sucks")
- Claim superiority on everything
- Get defensive about model size

**Do:**
- Acknowledge their strengths
- Highlight our unique advantages
- Show specific benchmarks

**Messaging:**
```
"GPT-4 is impressive for general tasks.

But for YOUR specific domain, a specialized model trained on 
YOUR data beats a generic model every time.

That's why we built domain cores.

Legal: 94% vs 72%
Code: 72% vs 67%
Finance: 93% vs 70%

And we're 60× cheaper."
```

---

### Versus Open Source (LangChain, AutoGPT)

**Don't:**
- Dismiss open source (we ARE open core)
- Claim we're easier (we're equally technical)

**Do:**
- Emphasize production-readiness
- Highlight continuous learning
- Show enterprise features

**Messaging:**
```
"Love LangChain? Us too. We use it internally.

But LangChain is a framework. You still have to build the agent.

AetherMind is a complete agent. Open core, production-ready, 
with continuous learning built in.

Think of it as LangChain + Pinecone + fine-tuned models + 
autonomous orchestration + safety layers + enterprise features.

All in one. Open source core. Self-hostable."
```

---

### Versus Vertical AI (Harvey, Glean)

**Don't:**
- Copy their positioning
- Compete on single vertical

**Do:**
- Emphasize platform approach
- Show cross-domain capabilities
- Highlight lower cost

**Messaging:**
```
"Harvey is great for legal. But what if you need legal + finance 
+ research in the same project?

AetherMind: One platform. Multiple domain cores. Seamless switching.

Legal research → Financial modeling → Market analysis.
One conversation. One memory. One agent.

And 5× cheaper than buying separate vertical tools."
```

## ✅ Brand Dos (Green Lights)

### Always Do These:

1. **✅ Show benchmarks**
   - Back every claim with data
   - Link to reproducible tests

2. **✅ Be specific**
   - "500K legal cases" not "lots of data"
   - "94% accuracy" not "highly accurate"

3. **✅ Acknowledge limitations**
   - "Day 1: 30% performance"
   - Builds trust

4. **✅ Compare honestly**
   - "GPT-4 is better at general knowledge"
   - "We're better at specialized domains"

5. **✅ Open source credibility**
   - "70% of code is public"
   - "Audit our safety layer"

6. **✅ Technical depth**
   - Don't dumb down for everyone
   - Technical audience appreciates detail

7. **✅ Evolution narrative**
   - "Gets better over time"
   - "Year 1 vs Year 3 comparison"

## 📱 Social Media Voice

### LinkedIn (Professional)

**Tone:** Thought leadership, data-driven, professional

**Example Post:**
```
The AI industry has a prompt engineering problem.

We're asking generic models to "act as" experts through clever prompts.

But prompts don't create competence. Training does.

That's why we built domain-specific cores:
• Legal: 500K cases
• Medical: 2M papers  
• Finance: 1M earnings reports

Result: 20-30% better accuracy than generic models.

No prompts. Just real expertise.

```

### Twitter/X (Direct, Sometimes Provocative)

**Tone:** Technical, bold claims, occasional hot takes

**Example Thread:**
```
Tweet 1:
Most "AI agents" are just ChatGPT with a cron job.

That's not autonomous. That's scheduled prompting.

Here's what real autonomy looks like: 🧵

Tweet 2:
Real autonomous agent:
• Decides WHEN to act (not scheduled)
• Decides WHAT to do (not prompted)
• Decides HOW to improve (self-modification)
• Learns from outcomes (continuous learning)

Tweet 3:
AetherMind runs 24/7. No prompts. No schedule.

Meta-controller decides what to research.
Practice loop improves skills.
Self-mod optimizes processes.

That's Gen 2 AI. Not prompt engineering.

Tweet 4:
Open source: github.com/aethermind
White paper: aethermind.ai/research

Prove me wrong 😎
```

---

### Reddit (Community-First)

**Tone:** Helpful, technical, no marketing speak

**Example r/LocalLLaMA Post:**
```
Title: We fine-tuned domain-specific 8B models. Benchmarks inside.

Post:
Hey r/LocalLLaMA,

We've been working on domain-specific fine-tunes of Llama-3-8B 
for different professional fields.

Results vs generic Llama-3-8B:
• Legal tasks: 72% → 94% (+22 points)
• Code (HumanEval): 45% → 72% (+27 points)
• Finance: 70% → 93% (+23 points)

Training data:
• Legal: 500K cases, 100K briefs (~2B tokens)
• Code: 10M repos (~5B tokens)
• Finance: 1M 10-Ks (~2.5B tokens)

All GGUF quantized (Q4, Q8). Self-hostable.

Open core (70% of stack): [github link]
Benchmarks: [link]
White paper: [link]

Happy to answer questions about training process, data sources, etc.

Edit: Proof this isn't vaporware: [benchmark runs]
