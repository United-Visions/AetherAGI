# Body (Interface Layer)

## 1. Directory Overview

The `body/` directory represents the "Enclosure" or interface layer of AetherMind. It is responsible for translating the abstract, internal "Intents" generated by the `brain` into concrete actions in the external world. This is where AetherMind's thoughts are turned into communication and interaction. Phase 1 focuses primarily on a linguistic interface (chat).

## 2. Current Capabilities

-   **Adapter Base (`adapter_base.py`):** A base class that defines the common structure for all body adapters. This ensures that new interfaces can be added in a modular and consistent way.
-   **Adapters (`adapters/`):** A sub-directory containing specific implementations for different interaction modalities. Each adapter is responsible for handling a specific type of output.

## 3. Interaction with Other Components

The `body/` directory is the final stage in AetherMind's response generation loop, acting as the bridge to the user.

-   **`orchestrator/`:** The `orchestrator` receives an "Intent" from the `brain` and, based on the context of the interaction, selects the appropriate adapter from the `body/adapters/` directory. It then passes the Intent to that adapter for execution. For example, a "linguistic response" Intent would be routed to the `chat_ui.py` adapter.
-   **`brain/`:** The `body` does not interact directly with the `brain`. The `brain` produces abstract thoughts, and the `body`'s job is to give those thoughts a physical or digital form. This separation allows the `brain` to focus on pure reasoning without needing to know the specifics of how to render text, synthesize speech, or control a robotic arm.
-   **`interface/`:** The output from a body adapter (e.g., the text generated by `chat_ui.py`) is sent back through the `orchestrator`'s API to be displayed by the frontend components in the `interface/` directory.

The `body/` directory provides the modularity needed for AetherMind to expand its interactive capabilities in the future, moving from text to speech, vision, and eventually physical embodiment, all without altering the core cognitive architecture.
